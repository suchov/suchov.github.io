I"’<p>When I first did remote, I didnâ€™t know what working from home was going to be like. As a programmer, Iâ€™m fairly social. I had never done it before. I was worried that Iâ€™d cabin fever with no division between my work and my home life. So, Iâ€™m still working at home, and I havenâ€™t gone crazy yet :) But I got some tips and rules that helped me out and Iâ€™d like to share them with you:</p>
